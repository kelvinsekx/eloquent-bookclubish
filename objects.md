# Objects

## Prototype
_Proto_ is from the Latin words **proto** and **typus**. Where proto means original, and typus mean model or form.
When combined, as in **proto-typus**, we could defined Prototype as an original copy or ancestral copy of something.

If we are to look it up from another view, we all know nothing is made from vacuum. In fact, if you are from a religious background, there is a belief that there is 
a spiritual **inheritance** of anything, like an unending chain of something.

In javascript, this is the same. Nothing ever existed from vacuum here. Every ojects has an ancestor, and ancestor has ancestors.
Simple because, **nothing ever existed from vacuum** :man_shrugging:.

Try putting `Object()` to a browser console, say firefox for example. Click the arrow that preceeded the return value and you would quickly see the prototype. Click into any of the properties in the prototype and you will notice and unending existence of prototype. This is to give you a practical experience of what we mean as *nothing exists in vacuum*

Just to provide a formal definition, Prototype is an object that contains lookable properties and can be used as a base [ancestor] for other objects. 

## Importance of prototype to javascript

- Inheritance
  Inheritance is about extending the functionalities, more preferable term would be properties, of one object into another.
  Prototype is popular for its use case with inheritance. This ensures that our code is reusable.
  
  In summary, prototype helps with code reuse.
  
- Enhance functionality
  A more general use case of prototype is to fortify the simplest of Object. It allows new objects automatically possess properties and functionalities from ancestors.
